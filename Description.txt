Project 2, by Kristina Gessel and Aarron Caudill This program analyzes workers’ networks at Barracuda National by using directed graphs to understand the relationships between workers. It also answers three questions about workers’ emailing habits that can be found by analyzing the graph. To accomplish this, we used a library called NetworkX to help us analyze the massive amount of data and make connections among employees.To build and run the program, type: “python Project2.py” into the terminal in the same directory that the code (Project2.py) is in.The program will run over a few seconds, then print out the answers to the four questions we considered. No input is required.As our fourth question, we chose to find the most influential employee, i.e. the employee who has communicated with the most people, at Barracuda National. Social networks can be better influenced if we know who the most influential person is. Social media uses this technique as well.The functions are documented above their definition, and comments throughout describe how the code works.
